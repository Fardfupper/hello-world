# hello-world
I wanna make a simple, but fun pixel game, like Pok√©mon Red.
I am a 19 year old who wants to make a game of my own, but I have no idea how coding or game design works. I don't even know the first thing on how to use GitHub. I only got this far because of the official GitHub guide I found online. I hope to become more savvy with coding in the future, not just for games, but in general.
